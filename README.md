# Mnist_Handwritten_Digit_Classification
MNIST digit classification with scikit-learn, Support Vector Machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent,Random Forest and KNN Classifier

The goal of this project is to define a process to differentiate between a dataset of Handwritten Digits and classify them into their respective digit class. This project also demonstrates the process of classification for any dataset in a simple way especially for the beginners in the field of machine learning. 

| Classification Algorithm        | Accuracy      | precision Score  | Recall Score |
| ------------------------------- |:-------------:| ----------------:| ------------:|
| stochastic gradient descent     | 0.8793        |0.8682            | 0.8607       |
| Random Forest                   | 0.9507        |0.9413            | 0.9411       |
| Linear SVM                      | 0.8571        |0.8397            | 0.8376       |
| KNN                             | 0.988         | 0.964            | 0.968        |


## Steps that I followed :
>Firstly I Fetch the data

>Then i applied different machine learning models:
-   SVM
-   KNN
-   Random Forest
-   Stocastic Gradient Descent

>Then I trained the model using the above mentioned classifiers

>I get the accuracy of 98.8%
